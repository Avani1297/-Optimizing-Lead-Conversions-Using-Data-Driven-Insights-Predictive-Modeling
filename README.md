##📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes lead quality trends and conversion drivers to determine if a 20% improvement in lead quality (from 8.0% to 9.6%) can justify a higher cost-per-lead (CPL) increase from $30 to $33.

Using exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical testing, and predictive modeling, key factors influencing lead conversion were identified, providing strategic recommendations for optimizing marketing efforts.

##🔍 Key Approaches
Trend Analysis – Examined conversion rates over time.
Statistical Testing – Used chi-square tests & regression analysis to validate insights.
Segmentation – Analyzed traffic sources, campaign performance, and audience behavior.
Predictive Modeling – Leveraged logistic regression & decision trees to identify high-impact factors.
##🎯 Expected Outcomes
Improved lead quality and conversion rates through better traffic allocation, targeting, and lead verification.
Enhanced budget efficiency and ROI optimization for advertisers.
Scalable strategies for long-term marketing performance improvements.
