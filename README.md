# Optimizing Lead Conversion: Data-Driven Strategies for Higher ROI
## 📌 Project Overview
In digital marketing, getting leads is easy—converting them is the real challenge. This project explores how traffic sources, audience segmentation, ad creatives, and campaign strategies impact conversion rates.

## 💡 Key Question: Can we improve lead quality by 20% (from 8.0% to 9.6%) to justify a CPL increase from $30 to $33?

Using EDA, statistical testing, and predictive modeling, we uncover actionable strategies to optimize lead acquisition and improve ROI.  

## 🔍 Methodology & Approach
📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Identifying trends in lead quality over time.  
📉 Statistical Testing – Using chi-square tests & regression analysis to validate insights.  
📌 Segmentation Analysis – Evaluating traffic sources, campaign performance, and user engagement.  
🤖 Predictive Modeling – Using logistic regression & decision trees to identify high-impact conversion factors.  

## 🎯 Key Findings & Insights
✅ Not All Traffic Sources Perform Equally – Some channels drive high-intent leads, while others just increase volume.    
✅ Campaign Performance Varies Greatly – 10x difference in conversion rates between top & low performers.  
✅ Ad Creative & UX Impact Conversions – Simple, trust-driven designs convert better than cluttered ads.  
✅ Data Quality is Key – Leads with verified contact details are 2.5x more likely to convert.  
✅ Segmentation Drives Performance – Strategic targeting & budget allocation improve lead quality and efficiency.
